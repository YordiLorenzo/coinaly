# Simpletrade

An easy too use mobile "on the go" trade interface for Bittrex, because Bittrex did a horrible job in providing a mobile friendly website.

## Why?
I find the Bittrex website not easy to use. The mobile version of their website is horrible. It's cluttered with information and does not visualize the things I want to know on a daily/hourly basis. With their API we can do things a little better.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Bittrex exchange with their offer of alt coins. But their website could use a little help.

## Features
- Instantly see the current status of your balances. Am I making a profit? Or am I losing money? (in progress)
- Fast selling and buying. Instantly react on market movements and quickly sell or buy a crypto coin. (in progress)
- Optimized for mobile screens and mobile performance. Always there with you. (in progress)
- Overview open orders. How are my orders performing? Should I cancel or adjust them? (in progress)
- Better live candlestick chart by [TradingView.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (in progress)

### Future
- Receive a notification when an order closed or cancelled
- Receive a notification when a coin is losing me money
- Track a single trade. You bought a coin and want to know how th√°t trade is performing.

### Far future
- Other exchanges

## Setup
Currently the setup is a self hosted solution, untill we figured out the most secure way to store your Bittrex API key and secrets.

For this setup we used the standard VueJS Webpack template. For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
