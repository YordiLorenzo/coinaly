# Simpletrade

An easy too use mobile "on the go" trade interface for Bittrex, because Bittrex did a horrible job in providing a mobile friendly website.

Alpha site: https://simpletrade.herokuapp.com/ (synced with the `master` branche)

This project is still in development. Screenshots above can already be different then the latest version.

## üì± Our mission 
We are here to create a fast and easy to use mobile (website) trade and portfolio interface for your favorite exchange. No more missed opportunities or trades because the website of your favorite exchange is too slow or too complicated to use. We optimize our website for easy mobile usage and give you the tools and insights you need on a daily basis. It‚Äôs more about you and your trades, and less about the exchange pushing you to buy coins.

Since this project is in the early development stage, we currently only support Bittrex. We plan on adding more exchanges in the future. 

## üöÄ Features
- Instantly see the current status of your balances and orders. Am I making a profit? Or am I losing money?
- Fast selling and buying. Instantly react on market movements and quickly sell or buy a crypto coin (in progress)
- Optimized for mobile screens and mobile performance. Always there with you
- Overview open orders. How are my orders performing? Should I cancel or adjust them?
- Easily see how far an open order is from the current market price
- Better live candlestick chart by [TradingView.com](https://www.tradingview.com/)
- Live updates all market data. No need to refresh yourself
- Easily browse and filter all available markets

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Javascript astronauts wanted 
We are currently looking for Javascript developers to speed up the development process, so we can add more exchanges in the near future. Preferably we are looking for skilled developers with professional VueJS en NodeJS experience. If you don‚Äôt fit that description, but you still want to help us out? That‚Äôs awesome! Please contact Jordy directly.

## üí∞ Fuel our efforts 
We are a hard working bunch of people and are not affiliated with Bittrex in any way. We are just using our spare time to create a better mobile experience for what we love to do: trading cryptocurrencies. 

Do you like what we create? A donation of any size is very welcome! 

BTC: 1P1sUUWxMXVCJX9T9M4SwoQW9Rpg51chfo 
ETH: 0x5442026e8c4CDA6361763D56318FbE94f1b1Cb9b

We use these donations to pay the bills, like web hosting and services to keep this project running. Ultimately we hope that with enough donations some of us can work on this project fulltime so we can push updates faster.

# üöß Developing for this project
Setup is only needed when you want to develop yourself. If you just want to try it out you can at our Alpha website: https://simpletrade.herokuapp.com/ 

This project is in early development, some features might not work yet.

## Bittrex API permissions
In order to use this you need to have a Bittrex API key so we can read your orders and balances. An Bittrex API key can be created here: [https://bittrex.com/Manage#sectionApi](https://bittrex.com/Manage#sectionApi). After creating, please remember the `key` and `secret`. We need that later in the setup.

**Read info** is the minimum required permission that needs to be enabled for your API key. **Trade limit** and **Trade market** are required if you want to trade from within the website. 

[View example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6d7r3qdox0fvt7/bittrexapikeypermissions.png?raw=1)

**!! Important !!**
We don't need **Withdrawal** permissions, so please leave that one off.
