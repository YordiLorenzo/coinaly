# Simpletrade

An easy too use mobile "on the go" trade interface for Bittrex, because Bittrex did a horrible job in providing a mobile friendly website.

## Why?
I find the Bittrex website not easy to use. The mobile version of their website is horrible. It's cluttered with information and does not visualize the things I want to know on a daily/hourly basis. With their API we can do things a little better.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Bittrex exchange with their offer of alt coins. But their website could use a little help.

## Setup
See `package.json` engines for the required dependency versions

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
