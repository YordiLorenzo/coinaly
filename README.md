# Simpletrade

An easy too use mobile "on the go" trade interface for Bittrex, because Bittrex did a horrible job in providing a mobile friendly website.

## Why?
I find the Bittrex website not easy to use. The mobile version of their website is horrible. It's cluttered with information and does not visualize the things I want to know on a daily/hourly basis. With their API we can do things a little better.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Bittrex exchange with their offer of alt coins. But their website could use a little help.

## Features
- Instantly see the current status of your balances. Am I making a profit? Or am I losing money?
- Fast selling and buying. Instantly react on market movements and quickly sell or buy a crypto coin.
- Optimized for mobile screens and mobile performance. Always there with you.
- Overview open orders. How are my orders performing? Should I cancel or adjust them?

### Future
- Receive a notification when an order closed or cancelled
- Receive a notification when a coin is losing me money
- Track a single trade. You bought a coin and want to know how th√°t trade is performing.
- Try out with other exchanges
