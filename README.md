# Simpletrade

An easy too use mobile "on the go" trade interface for Bittrex, because Bittrex did a horrible job in providing a mobile friendly website.

## Why?
I find the Bittrex website not easy to use. The mobile version of their website is horrible. It's cluttered with information and does not visualize the things I want to know on a daily/hourly basis. With their API we can do things a little better.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Bittrex exchange with their offer of alt coins. But their website could use a little help.

## Features

### Future

### Far future

## Setup
Currently the setup is a self hosted solution, untill we figured out the most secure way to store your Bittrex API key and secrets.

1. Download this Git repo
2. In that repo folder create a `.env` file with the contents:
```
BITTREX_API_KEY=XXX
BITTREX_API_SECRET=XXX
```
Where "XXX" is your Bittrex API key and secret which can be created here: [https://bittrex.com/Manage#sectionApi](https://bittrex.com/Manage#sectionApi). 

*API permissions*
Important: We don't need "withdrawl" permissions, so you can leave that switch off. "Read info" is the minimal permission, so we can read your balances and orders. If you enable "Trade limit" and "Trade market" you can also trade from within the website. But if you don't feel comfortable enabling that, we understand, you can leave it off.

3. Install all the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run in development mode: `npm run dev`

### Dependencies
See `package.json` engines for the required dependency versions.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Run development mode
``` bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

### Build for production
``` bash
# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

### Run tests
``` bash
# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For this setup we used the standard VueJS Webpack template. For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
